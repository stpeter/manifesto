A Public Statement Regarding Ubiquitous Encryption on the XMPP Network

Date: 2014-01-04
Version: 0.5

We, as operators of public services and developers of software
programs that use the XMPP standard for instant messaging and
real-time communication, commit to establishing ubiquitous encryption
over our network on May 19, 2014.

Jabber/XMPP technologies were first released on January 4, 1999, by
Jeremie Miller. Since then, channel encryption using Secure Sockets 
Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) has been optional on 
the Jabber/XMPP network. Out of respect for the users of our software 
and services, we believe it is time to make such encryption mandatory.

Therefore we commit to the following policies, consistent with the
IETF Internet-Draft "Use of Transport Layer Security in XMPP" 
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-saintandre-xmpp-tls/>.

For software implementations:

o support the STARTTLS method in XMPP as specified in RFC 6120, 
  including mandatory-to-implement cipher suites and certificate 
  validation consistent with RFC 6125

o prefer the latest version of TLS (TLS 1.2), but provide a 
  configuration option to negotiate TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0, or SSLv3
  for backward compatibility with existing deployed software

o disable support for SSLv2

o provide configuration options to require channel encryption for 
  client-to-server and server-to-server connections

o provide configuration options to prefer or require cipher 
  suites that enable forward secrecy

o prefer authenticated encryption (via digital certificates) for 
  server-to-server connections; if authenticated encryption is not
  available, provide a configuration option to allow fallback to 
  unauthenticated encryption with identity verification using the 
  XMPP Server Dialback extension (XEP-0220)

o ideally, provide user or administrative interfaces showing:
  o if a given client-to-server or server-to-server connection 
    is encrypted, authenticated, or both
  o the version of TLS and the cipher suite in use
  o details about a server's certificate
  o a warning about any changes to a server's certificate

For service deployments:

o require the use of TLS for both client-to-server and 
  server-to-server connections, preferably with authentication
  (RFC 6125) but as a fallback using unauthenticated encryption
  in the form of TLS plus Server Dialback

o prefer or require TLS cipher suites that enable forward secrecy

o if possible, deploy certificates issued by well-known and 
  widely-deployed certification authorities (it is known that 
  multi-tenanted hosting services are unable to obtain or 
  manage certificates for hosted domains)

The schedule we agree to is:

January 4, 2014 - first test day requiring encryption

February 22, 2014 - second test day

March 22, 2014 - third test day

April 19, 2014 - fourth test day

May 19, 2014 - permanent upgrade to encrypted network, coinciding
with Open Discussion Day <http://opendiscussionday.org/>

This commitment to encrypted connections is only the first step 
toward more secure communication using XMPP, and does not obviate 
the need for technologies supporting end-to-end encryption (such as 
Off-the-Record Messaging or OTR), strong authentication, channel
binding, secure DNS, server identity checking, and secure service 
delegation. Although we have worked to implement and deploy such 
technologies and will continue to do so, we believe that encrypting 
the traffic on the XMPP network is a necessary precondition to 
offering further security improvements.
